## Project "Code Embeddings for Wolfram Language"

In the project, it is implied to implement a system which shows the similarity between built-in functions of Wolfram Mathematica based on their context of usages. Illustrations should support the results. As an option, the solution could be updated to be able to generate names for expressions related to the semantics of them.

For the purpose, it is helpful to use code embeddings, which map the code to the vector space.  There are several methods based on machine learning successfully applied to different program languages [1]. They can be used as a baseline.
